                        Herb is a green-yellow colored cat with the mental sharpness of a five year old. He enjoys spending time with Adam, his best friend, caretaker and romantic interest. Herb spends most of his free time trying to understand the world around him with an optimistic attitude.

                    <h2>Meet Adam</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adam is a red colored car with severe depression and anger issues, but you can’t blame him. He spends all of his time with Herb because he has no choice. Whether he’s with Herb or not, he’s always in his head, regretting life decisions and yearning for a connection with someone he can relate to.
